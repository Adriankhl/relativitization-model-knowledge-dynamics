# Flocking model example

## Run the simulation

If you haven't cloned the [Relativitization](https://github.com/Adriankhl/relativitization) repo,
clone that somewhere out of this directory:

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/Adriankhl/relativitization.git

```

Run `createModelBase` task in `relativitization` to extract essential files to 
`relativitization/relativitization-model-base`:

```
cd relativitization
./gradlew createModelBase
```

Copy all essential files from Relativitization:

```
cd ../relativitization-model-flocking
cp -rT ../relativitization/relativitization-model-base/ .
```

Note that it also copies the `.gitignore` file to this directory. If you don't want to copy the
hidden file, run `cp -r ../relativitization/relativitization-model-base/* .` instead.

Now you can open this project with your favourite IDE that supports gradle, or you can try to run
the simulation on the command line:

```
./gradlew :simulations:run -PmainClass=relativitization.abm.KDScanTestKt
```

You can use `-PprocessorCount` and `-PramPercentage` to limit cpu usage and ram usage respectively:

```
./gradlew :simulations:run -PmainClass=relativitization.abm.KDScanTestKt -PprocessorCount=2 -PramPercentage=25
```
